After that time, 

1. Character in the zone of comfort: The character (you choose the name) starts out at home, where you choose the name, have his wife / husband kiss you, and you drive to work.
Today is the first day of character's new job at an IT firm.  The IT firm is called Safety First, and provides security services to other IT firms and startups world-wide.

2. They desire something: He wants to have an uneventful day at the office.  This is the character's first job after taking some time off to raise a child (independent of gender).  Since it has been a long time since the character has worked, he/she is dreading encountering problems he can not solve.

3. They enter an unfamiliar situation: The character enters the office, meets some of his co-workers, and hears that a sysadmin has just been fired.  He is asked by his supervisor to visit the server room and clean up the remnants of what the sysadmin left behind.  He is told he can keep anything of interest he finds.

Decrepit server room.  No one has been here in a long time. It is dark and bats fly out of it.

The player steps into the server room and is immediately met with bats flying out from the doorway, a disembodied voice talking to him, and a computer monitor which lights up and has an image of an AI talk to him.  The AI is friendly, and his name is ___ [think of AI name].  He points the character around different areas of the room and talks to him about
what the sysadmin used to be tasked with.

At this point the AI will give the player a puzzle to complete which will earn him the Hacker Mouse (A keyboard), his first item.

The AI also tells the hero he can come back for help.  

Dialogue ensues where the character shares his/her struggles with the AI.  The AI tells him, "I won't judge..."

At this point the player completes the challenge and feels accomplished.  He grabs all of his stuff and leaves the room.  The AI smiles a cheshire grin.

4. They adapt to the situation. The player feels like things are going well.  

5. They get that which they wanted.
6. They pay a heavy price for it.

7. They return to their familiar situation.

8. They have changed as a result of the journey.
Someone comments: Hey, nice keyboard.

At around 10:00AM Gloriano, a fellow employee, asks him if he wants to order some coffee from the kitchen downstairs.  

If the player says yes, Gloriano asks the player for their choice of coffee.

The player asks Gloriano if they need to go downstairs, and Gloriano responds that it's fine, they'll bring it up here.

If the player drinks coffee, some stuff will happen later when there is a puzzle which might involve sleep.

If the player doesn't, Gloriano will have some problem later on and say the player "must be a corporate coffee drinking" ~scoff.

1. Character in the zone of comfort: The character 

2. They desire something: The character is looking to keep going strong and finish up the day without any hiccups.

3. They enter an unfamiliar situation: Suddenly, at 11:11AM, all of the lights in the building go off.

People are distraught, and the character is asked to go to the breaker room which is off on the side of the building.

The character grabs a flashlight and heads out.  Once they are in the room, the character is treated to a panel which has a circuit and contains a circuit type of puzzle for the character to fix.

The character does not know how to fix circuits and needs a circuit manual.

The player doesn't know how to fix circuits.  If you talk to Gloria, she mentions that the sysadmin used to fix the circuits before.

Must go and talk to the AI.

[Problem] Not quite sure how tutorials for puzzles will work. The binary puzzle and this puzzle BOTH need to have some sort of feedback loop to let the player know what's going on.
