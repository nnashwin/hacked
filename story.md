After that time, 

1. Character in the zone of comfort: The character (you choose the name) starts out at home, where you choose the name, have his wife / husband kiss you, and you drive to work.
Today is the first day of character's new job at an IT firm.  The IT firm is called Safety First, and provides security services to other IT firms and startups world-wide.

2. They desire something: He wants to have an uneventful day at the office.  This is the character's first job after taking some time off to raise a child (independent of gender).  Since it has been a long time since the character has worked, he/she is dreading encountering problems he can not solve.

3. They enter an unfamiliar situation: The character enters the office, meets some of his co-workers, and hears that a sysadmin has just been fired.  He is asked by his supervisor to visit the server room and clean up the remnants of what the sysadmin left behind.  He is told he can keep anything of interest he finds.

Decrepit server room.  No one has been here in a long time. It is dark and bats fly out of it.

The player steps into the server room and is immediately met with bats flying out from the doorway, a disembodied voice talking to him, and a computer monitor which lights up and has an image of an AI talk to him.  The AI is friendly, and his name is ___ [think of AI name].  He points the character around different areas of the room and talks to him about
what the sysadmin used to be tasked with.

At this point the AI will give the player a binary puzzle to complete which will earn him the Hacker Mouse (A keyboard), his first item.

The AI also tells the hero he can come back for help.  

There could be a couple levels to the binary Puzzle.  The first being one from numbers 0 - 10, the second 0 - 100 and requiring you to flip digits, and the third 0-256 and requiring you to flip digits

Dialogue ensues where the character shares his/her struggles with the AI.  The AI tells him, "I won't judge..."

At this point the player completes the challenge and feels accomplished.  He grabs all of his stuff and leaves the room.  The AI smiles a cheshire grin.

4. They adapt to the situation. The player feels like things are going well.  

5. They get that which they wanted.
6. They pay a heavy price for it.

7. They return to their familiar situation.

8. They have changed as a result of the journey.
Someone comments: Hey, nice keyboard.

At around 10:00AM Gloriano, a fellow employee, asks him if he wants to order some coffee from the kitchen downstairs.  

If the player says yes, Gloriano asks the player for their choice of coffee.

The player asks Gloriano if they need to go downstairs, and Gloriano responds that it's fine, they'll bring it up here.

If the player drinks coffee, some stuff will happen later when there is a puzzle which might involve sleep.

If the player doesn't, Gloriano will have some problem later on and say the player "must be a corporate coffee drinking" ~scoff.

1. Character in the zone of comfort: The character 

2. They desire something: The character is looking to keep going strong and finish up the day without any hiccups. The player wants the lights back on.

3. They enter an unfamiliar situation: Suddenly, at 11:11AM, all of the lights in the building go off.

People are distraught, and the character is asked to go to the breaker room which is off on the side of the building.

The character grabs a flashlight and heads out.  Once they are in the room, the character is treated to a panel which has a circuit and contains a circuit type of puzzle for the character to fix.

The character does not know how to fix circuits and needs a circuit manual.

The player doesn't know how to fix circuits.  If you talk to Gloria, she mentions that the sysadmin used to fix the circuits before.

Must go and talk to the AI.

[Problem] Not quite sure how tutorials for puzzles will work. The binary puzzle and this puzzle BOTH need to have some sort of feedback loop to let the player know what's going on.

The player talks to the AI and the AI gives him an item which will open the breaker box.

The AI also asks him for a tutorial to learn how to turn on the breaker.

4. They adapt to the situation. 
The player goes into the breaker room with the appropriate key, opens the breaker box, and solves the puzzle.

The office is extremely excited, and the player is presented with cookies, which he must choose.

The day continues on uneventful.  The player thinks things are going well, and attends the 1:00PM meeting (because it's mandatory').

*Idea*During the meeting, say that it is mandatory, but try to use some wordplay to make it sound...intriguing.

Meeting mini-game.

Everyone gets into the meeting room, but the boss is late.

Interesting choices the player can make:
Which co-worker he sits by.
Whether or not he brings his laptop.

When the boss enters the meeting room, the projector doesn't seem to be working.

The boss asks anyone for help, and Judy says that "the new IT guy should handle it."

The character tries to tell Judy he is a sysadmin, and doesn't really handle that kind of thing, but Judy just smiles and retorts "Aww character, we KNOW you can do it!".

The character walks over to the projector and tv setup, and another circuit puzzle takes place.

The boss drones on and on about providing security for the common man, how advances in monitoring technology in the company will benefit the company as a whole, and brushes over the curious case of the sysadmin who was unemployed.

He pauses here for a miute and thinks before he decides to not say much more.

"[The Sysadmin] did good work for the company and we all wish him fair winds and smooth seas in all his ventures in the future."

You hear a type of crackling in the background, but it fades after a little while.

Later on, when the meeting is over, the boss asks you to stay behind.

After Gloriano, Judy, and Lisa leave, the boss sighs and sits down in the chair.

"We really took a big hit losing [Sysadmin]", he says to you.

You can choose to respond in a couple of ways.

The result of the conversation:
"Well [player], I'm just glad you are here now.  You have a pretty big office chair to fill..."

The boss thanks you and let's you return to your seat.

As you go to sit back down, an employee mentions the remote login is down to a certain site (Affco) and asks you to take a look at it in the server room.

This time, when you step back into the server room, the AI greets you with a more cool attitude.  He asks you some questions about your boss and what you guys talked about, and mentions a couple tidbits of what the previous sysadmin had to say about the guy.

You talk to him about remote connections, and he smiles and lets you know it's another puzzle. "And as you know [player], I LOOOVE puzzles...".

This AI is seriously creepy.
