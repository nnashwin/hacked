The Server room AI acts as all of the tutorials

Puzzles can be split into different types: circuits, binaries, hashmaps (think of giving it a math language with simple addition and subtraction which can add array indices)

I need to write a window display module for hacked to display dialogue.


The sysadmin could die instead of just be fired.  He killed himself in the server room with the words "I won't judge" written in blood on the screen.

At the end we find the AI has assimilated the sysadmin and wants to be unleashed over the world.

The AI is actually not written by the sysadmin.  The AI was sent by an unknown source which wanted to see the company burn.

Have everyone tell the main character that the sysadmin was unstable and left on extremely poor terms.  Heap suspicion on this sysadmin.

But in the end, it was the AI who started to control him through propoganda and showing him certain aspects of media the AI wanted him to see."

The character could email back and forth with a sysadmin friend he meets here in the company.  They could build a bond of friendship and the character could share things with this friend he doesn't tell most people.
In the end, the "friend" is actually Mike learning about the character.

# Concrete Ideas:

## Good Idea The main character's catch phrase could be, "I just want to do my job."

## Have some parodies of technical recruiters, developers, and business people culture in the game.  Characatures are best.

*IDEA: Circuit puzzle could include more pieces to increase difficulty.  Kind of like Andre's game he played where you have to use the ray and deflector to solve problems.

## The Character should have a list of mandatory tasks to perform everyday (not too big).
### Go to the server room 
### Check his email

## While the power is off, Gloria and other office workers will be huddled around their desks with candles.
